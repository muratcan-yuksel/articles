## Code list items with "show more/less" functionality in React

I want to display a list of elements on my page, and I want each element to have a "show more/less" functionality to expand and shorten the text at will.

For this, I will use React. I will fetch some fake data from the following dummy API => https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

I will use `axios` to do so.

I will have three pages in my structure: App.js, Texts.js, and Text.js.
