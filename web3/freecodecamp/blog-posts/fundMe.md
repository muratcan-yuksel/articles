These are my notes for Freecodecamp's we3/blockchain course Lesson 4: Remix FundMe

In this lesson, we're going to work with two contracts primarily: `FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol`. The idea is to create a smart contract that can be sent money in the form of native blockchain token (whether it be ethereum, avalanche, polygon, phantom or whatever else), that which can hold them until the owner of the contract withdraws them. Also, we want to keep track of who sent how much money. While doing that, we want to work with US dollars, but there's a catch in here: Blockchains are deterministic systems, closed boxes if I understood correctly, and they cannot get real-time value of ETH in USD. So, we need to use a third party service to convert the USD to ETH: Oracles- Chainlink in our case. Down the road, we'll be covering liraries, some weird Solidity math, and some advanced concepts to make our contracts more professional and more gas efficient.
