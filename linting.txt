TO start with ESLint
create a folder
maybe create a js file (app.js, index.js whatever)
run npm init like: npm init -y
(now we have a package.json file)
then run this code in your peoject folder :  npm install eslint --save-dev
now we have npm_ modules and package.lock.json too
then we need to initiate it by pasting: npx eslint --init
then, go to package.json file:
there, you'll find sth like this:  
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    }
after the test, paste this:
"Lint": "npx eslint yourfile.js"
so the outcome is like that:
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "lint": "npx eslint app.js"
  },
  add some code using bad practices
  now, if I write npm run lint in the terminal,
  it will find the mistakes I made in my app.js
  but instead of that, 
  I downloaded the eslint VSCode extension
  then, when I went to my app.js, I got a warning saying that Eslint was not enabled
  if I would like to enable it or not etc.
  I enabled it EVERYWHERE
  so I wonder if it'll work on my other js files too
  I chose AitBnb guide, and it doesn't want console.logs in the code
  so to disable that:
  go to your .eslintrc. file (use ls -a if you can't see it)
  and under the rules:, write this:
   "no-console": "off",
   
   TO ENABLE ESLINT ON AUTO-SAVE:
   There are many stupid videos on the web, but this one works:
   on Vscode, go to preferences-settings-extensions-eslint
   there, on the right top of the page, you'll see an icon, and if you hover it'll read "open settings (json)". go there
   turn the settings into this:
   "settings": {
		"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
			"source.fixAll.eslint": true
		  }
	}
	
	you see, the code is pasted inside the settings' brackets. 
	Now, when you autosave, linting will work
