- go to pinata.cloud
- upload the images folder you've created by running `node index.js` (you can find them in the build folder)
  -copy the CID provided on the dashboard after the upload. It's something similar to this => `QmY9KquiY4gfyPi2Jgz8Z7hJGjGP8pixqk9as2X8r3zeV1`
- Now go back to your config.js file inside the artwork collection, and change the baseUrl accordingly, like so => `const baseUri = "ipfs://QmY9KquiY4gfyPi2Jgz8Z7hJGjGP8pixqk9as2X8r3zeV1"; `
- go to the terminal (in the artwork project folder) and run => `node utils/updateBaseUri.js` (note that it's not Url with an L, but Uri with an "i")
- now go back to pinata and upload the json files.
