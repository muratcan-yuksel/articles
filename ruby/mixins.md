see, we're taking the module and including it in the classes. This method is called mixins. Now, we're able to use the jump funtion in Action module in our Rabbit and Cricket classes.



module Action
  def jump
    @distance = rand(4) + 2
    puts "I jumped forward #{@distance} feet!"
  end
end

class Rabbit
  include Action
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Cricket
  include Action
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

peter = Rabbit.new("Peter")
jiminy = Cricket.new("Jiminy")

peter.jump
jiminy.jump

## class mixins
Whereas include mixes a module’s methods in at the instance level (allowing instances of a particular class to use the methods), the extend keyword mixes a module’s methods at the class level. This means that class itself can use the methods, as opposed to instances of the class.
```
# ThePresent has a .now method that we'll extend to TheHereAnd

module ThePresent
  def now
    puts "It's #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? Time.new.hour - 12 : Time.new.hour}:#{Time.new.min} #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'} (GMT)."
  end
end

class TheHereAnd
  extend ThePresent
end

TheHereAnd.now
