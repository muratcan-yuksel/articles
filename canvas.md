# HTML Canvas

First off, we need to define it in the HTML like so =>

```html
<body>
  <canvas id="canvas" width="600" height="600"></canvas>
  <script src="./app.js"></script>
</body>
```

We will work with in in JS file. So we need to get the DOM element like we do with any other element=>

`const canvas= document.getElementById('canvas'); `
