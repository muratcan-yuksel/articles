As it happens in the real world, I want to fetch data from somewhere and display it in the UI. But I want to do more than just to display it, I want to be able to manipulate it in the UI in this or that way. Say, I want to give each individual part displayed in the UI a different color on click, but again, as it happens, I don't have the necessary structure in the data itself. Like, say I've been given a set of names, and I was asked to arrange them as such that the user should be able to determine if one or some of them engages in an action: such as going to a party.

As I've said, the data itself doesn't have anything for me to discern who will do what, it's just a collection of names like the one I've created and put in my public folder so that I can fetch it from there. Check this out =>

```
{
  "items": [
    { "name": "Anakin", "surName": "Skywalker" },
    { "name": "Padm√©", "surName": "Amidala" },
    { "name": "Obi-Wan", "surName": "Kenobi" }
  ]
}

```
