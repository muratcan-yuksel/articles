### documents

in mongodb are basically objects in JS

### what is Atlas?

Atlas is:
-my database in the cloud for this course and beyond
-Mongodb is used at the core of atlas for data storage and retrieval
-database as a service

#### atlas services

-manage cluster creation
-run and maintain database deployment
-use cloud service provider of your choice

### clusters

Atlas users can deploy clusters, that are groyps of servers that store data

### replica set

a few connected mongodb instances that store the same data

### Instance

is a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software

## in the terminal

### show dbs

shows the list of databases in the cluster

### choose a database

by
1)use name-of-the-db
2)show collections
collections listed

3- db.collectionName.find({"state":"somewhere})

### next page

with the 'it' command (from iterate

### how many from a query?

by adding count() method to the end of db.collectionName.find({"state":"somewhere})

### to make it readable

add .pretty() to the end of your query

## adding an empty query

would result on the display of the first 20 objects, unorgonized

## inserting documents

every document must have a unique underscore + id like so => {`_id`:}
there's this ObjectId() thing, dunno what's it exactly. Check this out => https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/#objectid

## inserting documents via mongo shell

insert() method

### steps to insert doc via mongo shell

1. connect to atlas
2. choose the collection via => use collectionName
3. db.documentName.findOne() => I guess it gives a random one. It's usually useless tho'.
4. copy this random document
5. db.documentName.insert(copied_document)

## inserting docs with order (inserting multiple docs)

e.g.
after insert, we use an array to insert multiple docs
db.documentName.insert([{"test":1},{"test":2},{"test":3}], {"ordered": false})=> see that, ordered key is added AFTER the array
this ordered key works in such a way: if there's a duplicate `_id` in the process of the array, the default behavior is that the insertion halts. With the ordered:false, everything else except the duplicate `_id` gets added.
-to create a database or collection, just write the name of the new collection or database, it'll be automatically created

## updating documents via mongo shell

we call the Mongodb query language MQL
-to update one => updateOne()
-to update many=> updateMany()
we use "$inc" command, I have a SS for it. Ä±t's long to write
that increments. But we can use another method too: we can use "$set" method which sets the value as we've specified.
"$push" operator will add a section to the array.

- $inc e.g. => db.zips.updateMany({ "city": "HUDSON" }, { "$inc": { "pop": 10 } })

-$set e.g.=> db.zips.updateOne({ "zip": "12534" }, { "$set": { "pop": 17630 } })

## deleting documents

-deleteOne()
-deleteMany()
work in a similar way to update values.

## delete collection

-show collections
-db.collectionName.drop()

## query operators

### comparison operators

$eq=> equal to
$ne => not equal to
$gt=> greater than
$lt => less than
$gte=> greater than or equal to
$lte=> less than or equal to
e.g. {"tripduration": {"$lte":70}}
so it is => {field: {operator:value}}

### a wholesome query example

-use sample_training
db.trips.find({"tripduration":{"$lte" : 70}, "usertype": {"$ne": "Subscriber"}})

e.g. => db.trips.find({"birth year":{"$eq": 1998}}).count() => 12
db.trips.find({"birth year":{"$gt": 1998}}).count()=> 18
