- go to hashlips_nft_contact folder
- copy the contents of the `SimpleNft_flat.sol `file
- open remix ide
- create a new workspace
- create a new contract (`myContract.sol`) and paste the contents of SimpleNft_flat.sol file
- on line 1235, you'll find the contract NFT. Change its name to your own contract name
- for test purposes, we choose `injected web3` as `environment`
- use rinkeby or ropsten or sth like that
- make sure your contract is selected on deployment
- when you choose the correct address, under the deploy section, you'll find that you'll need to enter the contents of your constructor. such as \_NAME, \_SYMBOL and all. From where do we get these details?
- the name and the sumbol, we give them
- for the `_INITBASEURI`, we'll go to pinata again
- then, we copy the url for our metadata, and add a `/` (forward slash) at the end of it. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. And, we need to add `ipfs://` to the beginning of it. So, our content for the `_INITBASEURI` should be like this =>
  `ipfs://QmPNSjqVCgsKeXA8ubY8os5WV2kyLY5szxJwAhZh21kBpF/`
- again, don't forget the forward slash at the end
- I didn't add a hidden NFT so `_INITNOTREVEALEDURI` will be empty in this case
- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT STEP=> before clicking anything like transact or sth like that, copy the contents of the contract `by clicking the copy symbol next to the transact button `
- now since you've copied that thing, go to the root folder and create a folder named `info`
- inside that `info` folder, create `ethereum-text.md` (or txt, doesn't really matter) and `polygon-test.md` (again, extension doesn't matter) and paste the contents so that you can save and access them whenever you need. This is needed when you need to verify your contract.
- now you can go to `https://testnets.opensea.io/` to see your collection. Notice that we're on the test network, as we've deployed our contract on rinkeby test network. Opensea wouldn't show test networks normally.
