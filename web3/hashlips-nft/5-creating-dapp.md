- copy your ABI (you can find it in the solidity compiler section in remix IDE, at the very left bottom, under the compilation details button)
- save the ABI in somewhere safe.
- the ABI is in JSON format
  ## note that we're doing these things on polygon
  not that it matters but, the file names are according to that
  so don't let that confuse you
  ## end of NB
- create a new file in the info folder that holds the information that'll be useful later, and name that file `polygon_contract`
- paste your whole contract in that file

## verifying smart contract

- copy your contract address (that you've saved in a file, it's a one-liner)
- search for your contract address on etherscan or polygonscan (depends on which blockchain you've deployed it to)
