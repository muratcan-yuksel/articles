-you can choose the test mode. Dunno the difference exactly.
-in the firestore, start a collection. Enter a name for the collection
-fields are key-value pairs. Like title, city etc. write whatever you want
-add a value to it. It's like creating objects. 
-go to the main place of the project and click on </> add your web app. Follow the instructions
